            Chuck Berry.
            Acknowledging his nationality as often as possible in a bid to point out how he is unfairly identified and
            treated as an “American”.
            Playing with balls, be they his own or not has been a long time interest of Bryces. He also likes
            baseball.r</p>

        <h3>background: </h3>
        <p>Having been dragged up somewhere in the south of the United States he managed to escape after finding himself
            a “Suga’ Mama” who goes by the name of Ashley. Her well-paid employment affords Bryce the opportunity to
            focus on the more delicate aspects of life, like working on his killer sleeve tats, or investigating more
            effective ways to groom his beard. Bryce has always had a penchant for travelling and embarking on this new
            aspect of his life must have had a positive effect on his personality as he certainly comes across as a
            genuinely decent fella.</p>

        <h3>Most likely to: </h3>
        <p>Have children with a complex about being unable to grow magnificent beards.</p>

        <h3>Key moment:</h3>
        <p>When Bryce, in a typical low-key American fashion, saw what he believed to be the teams for this hackathon
            and went on to showcase just how nice a person he can be by saying something nice about each member of his
            team, which he then realised was not his actual team.</p>
